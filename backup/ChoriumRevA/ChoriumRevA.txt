 This is package of Chorium[ko:rjum] Revision A. There has been no sound sample 
changes/additions, but there's been many parameter tunings. Some can hear the 
changes, some may not. I hope you the former. :)
(I'm pretty sure that most listeners can hear the improvements of Piano 1. Try it.)

 Almost of the parameter tunings are focused on the velocity expressions. 


 Enjoy the More Tuned Chorium.
